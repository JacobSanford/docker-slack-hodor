# jacobsanford/slack-hodor
Docker container : leverages [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) and [python-rtmbot-hodor](https://github.com/JacobSanford/python-rtmbot-hodor) to listen for mentions of Hodor's name in a Slack channel and replies with a message.

Messages are pre-defined from a basic module import and classified by mood.

The 'mood' of reply is determined by comparing the content of the triggering message against a library of words and human interpreted intent scoring. After mood assignment, a message is chosen based on a 'item drop' type selection process that allows for weighting of responses.

## Usage
```
docker run \
       --rm \
       --name hodorbot \
       -e SLACK_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN_OBTAINED_FROM_SLACK_INTEGRATION> \
       jacobsanford/slack-hodor
```
